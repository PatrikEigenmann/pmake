 * The ManPage struct is a crucial data structure designed to streamline and enhance the management of
 * manual pages within your applications. It encapsulates all the necessary details of a manual page,
 * including the filename and its corresponding content, into a single, organized unit. This structured
 * approach not only simplifies the creation and modification of documentation but also ensures that your
 * manual pages are consistently and efficiently handled across different platforms.
 * 
 * By leveraging the ManPage struct, your development team can achieve greater efficiency, maintainability,
 * and clarity in managing application documentation, ultimately contributing to a more robust and
 * user-friendly software experience.
